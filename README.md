# Client-Server
This project integrates client-side (C++) and server-side (Java) components to create a versatile interactive system. The client-side, developed in C++, manages user interactions and establishes communication with the server, efficiently handling user inputs and transmitting them for processing. On the server-side, implemented in Java, the system supports multiple communication models. It can operate using a Thread-per-Client (TPC) model, where each client connection is handled with dedicated threads, ensuring robust handling of client requests and independent session management. Alternatively, it utilizes the reactor pattern for event-driven scalability, allowing the server to efficiently manage multiple clients and respond to events dynamically. This architecture underscores proficiency in C++ for client-side logic and Java for scalable server-side operations, offering flexibility in communication models to enhance responsiveness in interactive applications.
