# Client-Server
In this project, I developed a community-led World Cup update subscription service where users can subscribe to game channels to send and receive updates about ongoing matches. The server, implemented in Java, provides STOMP (Simple-Text-Oriented Messaging Protocol) services and supports both Thread-Per-Client and Reactor server patterns. On the client side, I used C++ to enable users to interact with the server and other subscribed users. The system allows users to log in, join game channels, report game events, and receive updates. The project required implementing STOMP protocol communication, handling message frames, and ensuring proper client-server interactions to provide real-time updates and notifications.
